## About the Bid Calculation Tool

* Backend : https://github.com/roycatherine/techtest-backend

## Techs

* Docker
* Vue3
* Vuetify
* Javascript
* HTML

### Setup

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) is used for development environment. We use
[docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to start everything you need to run the project. 

### Installation

1. If not already done, install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. [Backend](https://github.com/roycatherine/techtest-backend) must be installed to work.
3. Run `docker compose up -d` in the project's directory to build the container and start all services.
4. The site will be accessible on http://localhost:8000/. You must not have anything else running on that port. Wait a few seconds for Vuetify to load.
5. Have fun!
